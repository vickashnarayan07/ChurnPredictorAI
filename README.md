# ChurnPredictorAI
Powered by the Logistic Regression model, ChurnPredictor is a machine learning application designed to predict customer churn based on core customer data. The model is trained using a dataset consisting of various customer attributes, such as age, gender, contract type, and monthly charges, to predict the likelihood of customer churn (whether the customer will leave or stay).
